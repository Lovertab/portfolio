Module 2 Challenge - Professional Portfolio

For this assignment, I created a bare portfolio site where I will be including the assignments and work I've done. I incorporated flexbox, media queries, and other CSS variables to make my site dynamic and responsive. I added UI scrolls connecting each section of the page. I have an about me section, my work, and how to contact me as well as my resume.
